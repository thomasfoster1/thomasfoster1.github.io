<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities.

The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>

<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry. Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders.

This class includes reach trucks, in which the operator guides the fork to reach up and grab pallets, and order pickers, in which the operator platform can be raised and lowered to grab individual items when putting together an order.</p>
