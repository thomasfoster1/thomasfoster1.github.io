<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>But it's basically a powered industrial truck which is used to lift and transport materials in businesses, most commonly goods that are stacked on pallets. Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. With these batteries, you benefit from our 2Shifts1Charge guarantee, which is unrivalled in the logistics sector: Our electric counterbalance trucks can complete two consecutive shifts without the need for battery replacement or top-up charging.</p>
