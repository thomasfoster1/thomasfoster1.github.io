<p>A rough terrain forklift is durable and adaptable, making an excellent addition to a workforce that works hard across challenging terrain. Due to the widely varying types of fork lifts produced, fork lift operation may require certification and licensure. Truck frame - the base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>

<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
