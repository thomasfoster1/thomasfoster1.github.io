<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
