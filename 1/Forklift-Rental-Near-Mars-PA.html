In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
