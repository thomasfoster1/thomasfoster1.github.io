<p>France and Italy are on the upsurge of adopting the electric Forklift Trucks, which would be a key driver for the trucking industry in the region. These advanced electric forklifts are equipped with the newest generation of AC technology, assuring you industry-leading performance.

Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>
<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.

<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>Whether your company is in the market for a new forklift, or if a pre-owned forklift is more appropriate, Granite Industrial can guide you through the buying process.
