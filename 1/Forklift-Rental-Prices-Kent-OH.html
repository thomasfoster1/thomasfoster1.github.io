<p>Although Hangcha's 35 series of rough-terrain forklifts hasn't moved to electric yet, Wang says Hangcha has developed the A160 16 T electric forklift to meet market demand. It turns out that lifted trucks do more than just look cool — this modification brings some key benefits. Now, it is not a guaranteed lock that your driving experience will immensely improve after investing in a lifted truck.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
