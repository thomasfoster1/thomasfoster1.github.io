In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>

They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers.
