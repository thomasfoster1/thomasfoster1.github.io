In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks.

<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
