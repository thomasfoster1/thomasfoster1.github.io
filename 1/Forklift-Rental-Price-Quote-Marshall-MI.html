<p>RT forklifts are ideal for smaller jobsites, due to it's lower cost and maneuverability. Constructed to fit in narrow aisle spaces, a forklift maneuvers around crowded warehouses with ease. Therefore, no matter what the specific characteristics are of the individual pallet jack, it is still one of the most versatile and usable pieces of moving equipment for any business to have readily available for everyday use.</p>

<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>

The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>

<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work. TPC's video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
