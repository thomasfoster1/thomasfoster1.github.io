The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>1. Counterbalance - Counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in virtually all material handling capacities. An electric pallet jack. In keeping with design advances in many other types of electronic technology, a number of RT forklift models are available with telematics systems, such as JCB's Livelink and Case's SiteWatch.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>

Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>
