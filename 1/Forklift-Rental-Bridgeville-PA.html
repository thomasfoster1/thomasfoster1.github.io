<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts.

Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost.

Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Those same bumps and bounces that give off-road riding much of its thrill also wear out your rig's systems, especially the suspension. Maximal's New "A" Series Forklift is designed for the driver.
