The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck.
