This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>

Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks. Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety.
