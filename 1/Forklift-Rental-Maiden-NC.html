<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting. Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>
<p>Unlike other online shops, our customer support representatives are actual mechanics who are seasoned in fitting, installing, and maintaining truck and SUV air suspension. For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>

<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
