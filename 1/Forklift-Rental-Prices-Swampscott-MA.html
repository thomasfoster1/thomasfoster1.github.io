<p>High-quality forklift trucks are an essential component of any future-proof intralogistics solution.

Welcome to Dave Arbogast Lifted Trucks, located in Troy, Ohio.

But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you outâ€”and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
