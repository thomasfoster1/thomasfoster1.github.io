<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>

<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.
