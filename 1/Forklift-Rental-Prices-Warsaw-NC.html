<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks. Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations.

In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
