<h3>Heavy Duty Forklift Antigo WI</h3>
<p>Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads. The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series. We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
