<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>

Known for being highly versatile machines, these forklifts are capable of handling heavy loads from 2.5 tonnes up to 7 tonnes.</p>
<p>Often one or more of these three types of reach trucks are used in warehouses. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks. For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>
