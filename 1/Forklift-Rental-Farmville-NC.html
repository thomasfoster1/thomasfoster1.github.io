<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
