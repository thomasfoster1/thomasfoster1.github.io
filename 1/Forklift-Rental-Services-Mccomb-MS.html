<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas. Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
