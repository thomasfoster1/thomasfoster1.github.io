<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets.

Suspension lift kits are completely different from body kits in terms of structure.</p>
<p>Sideloaders are trucks that operate by picking up their load from the side and travel parallel to the length of the load, from the perspective of the operator. An electronic narrow aisle forklift with an operator platform costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000. Ideal for lifting pallets and heavy loads, stacking in warehouses, loading and unloading trucks. At Bugle Forklift we carry stock on both new and used equipment with over 170 units in our fleet and access to thousands more pending on your companies requirements.</p>
