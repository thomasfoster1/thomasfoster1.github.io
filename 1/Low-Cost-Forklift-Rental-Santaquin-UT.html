<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.)
