Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many lift kits and the companies that sell and install them, fail to educate consumers about the differences in their vehicle's handling that can impact safety behind the wheel.
