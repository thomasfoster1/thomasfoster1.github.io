Known also as forklift truck, fork truck or forklift, it was developed in the early 20th century. There are three main types of class 7 rough terrain forklifts, and all are designed a little differently for varying purposes. Eliminate your parts and service departments - If you currently own your fleet and maintain it you need mechanics, tools and parts.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation.
