<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years.

With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
