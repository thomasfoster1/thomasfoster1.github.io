<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

The Fork Lift Truck licence allows you to operate a Fork Lift Truck for 3 years. 123Forklift has Thousands of used forklifts in stock in over 75 locations across North America making it the largest network of forklift dealers in the U.S and Canada.
