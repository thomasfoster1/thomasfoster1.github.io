Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

<p>Newer forklifts are easier to rent. The rear end of the forklift swings in a circle around the front wheels that support most of the load. Liftking has a diverse product offering, ranging from a variety of RT forklift configurations, to application-specific custom forklifts, to heavy-duty transporters.

Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
