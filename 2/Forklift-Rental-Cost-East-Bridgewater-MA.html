<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Stability - An order picker forklift must retain its stability even when picking goods at high elevations. Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity. When you want the latest and greatest in forklift tech for your business, it's typically easier to rent than buy. These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
