<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

What's unique about this type of forklift is that the mast can turn left or right independent of the body of the truck.</p>

Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>Your rental supplier can provide you with operator training for an additional fee if you require this training for your drivers. Most rented forklifts include a full maintenance package that covers all consumables, repairs, etc. No matter what type of project, we'll find the forklift that's best suited to your needs.
