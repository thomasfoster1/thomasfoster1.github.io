Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach‚Äù into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
