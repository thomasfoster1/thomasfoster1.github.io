<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks.

CASE rough terrain forklifts feature an industry standard ITA class 3 carriage and forks allowing a wide range of aftermarket attachments.
