They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>

If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware.
