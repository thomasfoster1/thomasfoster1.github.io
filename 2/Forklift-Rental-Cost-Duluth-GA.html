If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>It's part of our mission to build long-term, lasting partnerships with all of our customers, from the time of purchase forward, which is why we offer a full docket of services, including parts and maintenance , safety and training certification classes , warehouse design , and more.
