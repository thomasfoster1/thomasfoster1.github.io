The 35 Logistics counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Counterbalance and reach forklifts are two commonly used types of truck throughout a variety of industries.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
