With our years of industry experience, we are able to successfully cater to the variegated demands of our clients by offering them Standard Pallet Truck. As you drive into a left-hand corner, the right tire will increase in weight as the vehicles weight is transferred from the centerline.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>
