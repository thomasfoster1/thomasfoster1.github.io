<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>

We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.‚Äù KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015.

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
