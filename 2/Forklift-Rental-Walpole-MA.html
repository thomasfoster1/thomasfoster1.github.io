Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas. Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.
