This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>

<p>This ensures that each rough terrain forklift is compliant with all relevant regulations, standards and accreditations, ensuring user safety as well as operational durability. Tuff Country offers kits ranging from 1.5" leveling kits to 6" suspension lift kits. When it comes to forklifts, there are many types to choose from, each with their own unique characteristics and jobs they're suited to.
