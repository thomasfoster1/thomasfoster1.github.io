<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Riding on unfathomable volumes of industrial expertise, we are offering an extensive range of High Lift Pallet Truck.</p>

<p>It had a capacity of 6,000 pounds (2,724 kg) at a lift height of 22.5 feet (7 m), or 3,000 pounds (1,362 kg) at 35 feet (11 m). In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>The Raymond 7000 Series reach trucks are engineered for productivity in narrow aisle applicationsâ€”handling small footprints and maximum throughput needs with over 200 configurations available.

<p>This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.
