From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

That is what we have taken that out of the equation for you, with our delivery service for all new machinery and forklift rentals in our range.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground.

Counterbalanced = A lift truck that utilizes weight in its chassis to counterbalance a load against the center line of the drive wheels. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>
<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician. The fall-arresting system must not interfere with the raising and lowering of the forklift platforms. Cat lift Trucks has developed two specialised order pickers to meet these needs.

To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The Teletruk can often do the work of five machines on site - a Conventional Masted Forklift Truck, Skid Steer Loader, Compact Telescopic Handler, Rough Terrain Forklift and a Compact Wheeled Loader.
