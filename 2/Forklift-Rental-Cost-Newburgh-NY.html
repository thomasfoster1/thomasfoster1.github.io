<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Newburgh</h2>
<p>These lift trucks are meant to operate in narrow aisles and are best for storing and retrieving pallets in racks. The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet.

<p>This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck.

Whether you need to purchase or rent, Northwest Forklift can provide quality new and used forklifts.</p>

Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
