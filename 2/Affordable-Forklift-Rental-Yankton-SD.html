<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks.
