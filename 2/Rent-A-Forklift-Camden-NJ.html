<h3>All Forklift Types Camden NJ</h3>
<p>Sleep soundly knowing that your business is covered when you buy a new forklift, used forklift or rent a forklift from us. Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains. The operator stands in a sideways compartment and the side loader unloads objects on its side. When we start talking about lifting trucks, lift kits, etc.</p>
<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>

For Xtreme, limiting the turning radius of the machines is a focus, and the three larger models have an outside turning radius of 13 feet 7 inches. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation.</p>
