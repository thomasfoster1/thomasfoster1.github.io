<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>The company says its new products offer advances in efficiency technology with Toyota's optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking. As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be. With a suspension lift, the wheels are pushed down from the frame and come in different varieties such as coil-spring bushings, leaf spring shackles of full-blown suspension kits.</p>
