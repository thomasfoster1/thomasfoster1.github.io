<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>With that much juice, the 2C5000 can lift a full payload at 125 ft per minute while an empty payload reaches 130 fpm. The best thing about rough terrain forklifts is that they allow you to work in places traditional forklifts can't go.

<h2>Hydraulic Material Handling Equipment Muskegon </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over.

Forklifts have been lifting America's economy for over a century and we can now quantify our industry's economic contributions to the overall U.S. economy,” said Brett Wood , president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America and chairman of ITA.</p>
