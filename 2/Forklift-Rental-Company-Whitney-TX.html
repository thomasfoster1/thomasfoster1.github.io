Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks.

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Today's leaders, especially Toyota and KION, continue to expand their reach beyond industrial trucks and into the broader market for supply chain services. As a forklift operator, you don't have to worry about the load center as long as you respect the listed weight capacity and keep the load balanced.
