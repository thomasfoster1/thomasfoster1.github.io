Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites.

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades. Please note there will be an additional LO Licence processing fee payable to WorkSafe upon successful completion of your forklift training course.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
