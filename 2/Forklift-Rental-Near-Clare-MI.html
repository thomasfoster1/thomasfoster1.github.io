<p>Toyota provides complete safety training for forklifts. OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor‚Äù tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity of the truck.</p>
