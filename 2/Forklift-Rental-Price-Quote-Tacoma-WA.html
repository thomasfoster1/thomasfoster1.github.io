On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.
