<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO.

Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.” This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work. Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks.</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for.

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
