<p>Keep your credit line clear - Unlike financing equipment, long-term rentals have little impact on your ability to borrow money to increase your business. Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>Sit down forklift has a seat for a rider which faces the mast. At Lifted Trucks Only we like to say that we are in the business of making automotive dreams a reality.

<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.‚Äù But that's not 100% true anymore.
